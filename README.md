# ðŸ“Š Task 4 â€“ Aggregate Functions & Grouping (SQL Developer Internship)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains SQL queries using aggregate functions and grouping techniques as part of Task 4 of my SQL Developer Internship. The queries are written against the `LibraryDB` schema designed in Tasks 1 to 3.

The goal is to summarize, group, and analyze tabular data using aggregate functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY` with optional `HAVING`.

## ðŸ§¾ What's Included

- Use of key aggregate functions: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`
- Grouping data using `GROUP BY`
- Filtering grouped data using `HAVING`
